# NekoScript
That's it. I just made this programming language to keep myself busy, and because of my passion for nekos, I went with that name.

You are more than welcome to report bugs, note that some stuff is not yet implemented.

Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/Rubenennj/nekoscript/tree/dev/examples).

# Installation
Head over to [releases](https://github.com/Rubenennj/nekoscript/releases) and download the latest tag (the executable file).
Once done, move the executable to a place it won't bother you much and copy the folder where you put the file.
Search for system environment variables on your PC, go to `Path` and add a new path which would be the folder path you previously copied.
Once done, you can use `nekoscript` in any terminal/console allocated on your PC.
